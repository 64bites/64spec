6502/Commodore64 Testing Framework for KickAssembler

## Video introduction

[![Video](docs/022.png?raw=true)](http://64bites.com/episodes/022-tdd-with-64spec/)
## Installation

### Recommended way

1. Create a dir for libraries that your KickAssembler projects use.
2. Get the current version of the 64spec.asm file and put it in this dir along with other libraries. 
3. Import it in your spec files as <code>.import source "64spec.asm"</code>
4. Make sure to pass option <code>-libdir <path-to-your-libraries-dir></code> when compiling with KickAssembler.

### If you just want to try it out

1. Get the current version of the 64spec.asm file and put it in the same directory as your spec files.
2. Import it in your spec files as <code>.import source "64spec.asm"</code>

## Quick Start

#### 1. Create file example_spec.asm

``` asm
.import source "64spec.asm"

sfspec: :init_spec()
  
  // TODO: Add assertions here

  :finish_spec()
```

![Empty Spec](docs/qs01-empty.png?raw=true "Empty Spec")

#### 2. Add first failing assertion.

``` asm
.import source "64spec.asm"

sfspec: :init_spec()
  
  :assert_a_equal #42

  :finish_spec()
```

![Empty Spec](docs/qs02-fail.png?raw=true "Empty Spec")

#### 3. Make it pass

``` asm
.import source "64spec.asm"

sfspec: :init_spec()

  lda #42
  :assert_a_equal #42
  
  :finish_spec()
```
